## Computer vision

Here are the computer vision projects I've made so far.

1. Cats vs Dogs: This is a classic computer vision classification problem. The objective is to create an AI that when presented with an image of a cat or a dog, can correctly label it as one or the other, for this I used Python + Keras + Tensorflow. I applied the transfer learning technique on the MobileNet model, which was pre-trained on ImageNet, with this I was able to train just the top layers with my data, saving a lot of time and still getting an accuracy of 98.3% on unseen data.
