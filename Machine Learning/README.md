## Machine Learning

Here are some of my Machine Learning projects made with Python + Scikit-learn.

1. Blight flagging: This project uses a data set from the city of Detroit about blight violation. It contains information about the violation, the issued ticket and if the ticket was paid or not. The objective is to use machine learning methods to predict if a given ticket will be paid. For this I used a RandomForestClassifier model for its efficiency when presented with many parameters and low overfitting risk. The comments on the file for this project are in Portuguese.

2. Credit Card Fraud: This project is based on a fraud detection dataset, it is highly imbalanced (only 0.17% are classified as fraud) and has 28 columns unnamed for confidentiality reasons. The objective is to predict if a transaction is fraudulent or not, which I was able to do with 99.97% accuracy and 92% true positive rate using a random forest classifier model with SMOTE for oversampling the minority class. The comments on the file for this project are in English.
